# BoTW Map Percentage Calculator
BoTW Map Percentage Calculator  
By Sean Allgaier

A calculator I wrote for figuring out the remaining collectibles that contribute to the percentage meter in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

After collecting all korok seeds, shrines, and defeating all Diving Beasts my map was stuck at 97.63% for the longest time so after much frustration I figured I'd design a calculator to help me figure out what was left. After doing some research online, I managed to find the percentage weights for all of the different categories that contribute to the total percentage which I was then able to use to figure out how many locations were left.  

• Divine Beasts		4 total	  		0.0825% each 	 	0.33% total
• Shrines	120 total		0.0825% each		9.9% total
• Map Locations		188 total		0.0825% each		15.51% total
• Korok Seeds		900 total		0.0825% each		74.25% total










I first wanted to make sure the logic of my code worked first. I'll eventually get around to the To Do list below, though I'm not sure when per se.
To do:
• Interactive GUI
• Making a version for Tears of the Kingdom (More research needs to be done on the percentage weights for each category)
• Further Bug Testing/Fixing?
• Clean-up/optimize code?



I'm merely a Computer Science student so I know my code isn't as perfect or efficient as it could be, however, I am open to all forms of constructive feedback and criticism.
